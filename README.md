# NBA Travel Distances

With all 22 teams taking part in the NBA's restart in Orlando, no teams have to travel once they arrive. For each team's remaining 8 regular season games, who would've had to travel the most (or least) if games were played in each team's cities?

Findings:

1. Portland would have to travel nearly 8,000 miles, with games at Boston and Brooklyn. 
2. Washington would only travel 2,700 miles. Its furthest game is just over 1,100 miles away (less than 200 miles further than Portland's shortest road trip). 
3. Both from LA, the Lakers and Clippers have a large disparity in their (would-be) travel distances. The Lakers would have to travel 6,000 miles (5th most), compared to the Clippers' 3,000 miles (2nd least).
