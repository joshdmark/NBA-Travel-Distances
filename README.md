# NBA Travel Distances

With all 22 teams taking part in the NBA's restart in Orlando, no teams have to travel once they arrive. For each team's remaining 8 regular season games, who would've had to travel the most (or least) if games were played in each team's cities?

Findings:

1. Portland would have to travel nearly 15,000 miles, with games at Boston and Brooklyn. 
2. Washington would only travel less than 6,000 miles. Its furthest game is just over 1,100 miles away (less than 200 miles further than Portland's shortest road trip). 
3. Despite playing against each other, the Clippers and Lakers are 9th and 11th respectively in most hypothetical miles traveled.
